# ChatBot Using Torch

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a chatbot built using PyTorch. The chatbot leverages deep learning techniques to understand and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner.

## Features
- Implemented using PyTorch
- Uses NLP techniques for text processing
- Custom neural network model for response generation
- Training pipeline with dataset support

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch nltk numpy
```

## Usage
Run the chatbot script:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

Modify hyperparameters in `config.py` as needed.
